# ServiceNow report mapper



# Motivation

The main reasons why I've built this, is to learn Rust and to get a bit more familiar with OpenAI. As a
"starter project" I've decided to train a model so that it's able to determine an appropriate assignment group for a
ServiceNow incident, based on the incident title. In order to that, I need training data in the appropriate format.
